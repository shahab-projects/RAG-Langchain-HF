question,answer
What is 5G?,"5G is the fifth generation of wireless technology, offering significant improvements over 4G, including much faster data speeds, lower latency (reduced delay), and greater capacity for more devices. These enhanced capabilities enable faster downloads, smoother streaming, and more responsive applications like virtual reality and remote control systems. Key technologies like network slicing also allow networks to be customized for specific needs, supporting everything from massive numbers of sensors in the Internet of Things (IoT) to mission-critical industrial uses."
Who developed PyTorch?,"PyTorch was originally developed by Facebook AI Research (FAIR), which is now known as Meta AI. The development of PyTorch began in 2016 as an open-source machine learning framework, building upon the Torch library. While initially a project within Facebook, its administration was transferred to the neutral PyTorch Foundation, part of the Linux Foundation, in 2022 to foster broader community collaboration and development."
